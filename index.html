      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <hr>

      <p>Thank you for taking a moment to learn more about our story. Long ago, God began stirring our hearts towards adoption. Adoption is such a beautiful picture of the grace and love of Jesus and how he invites us into His family to become sons and daughters of the most high King. In that spirit, we begin our journey towards bringing our daughter home.

<br><br>Earlier this year, we began praying and asking God to show us the location where we would adopt. We are excited to announce that we have decided upon Colombia and will be partnering with All God's Children as we enter into this next phase.

<br><br>There are several ways you can partner with us and the first being prayer. Prayer has carried and sustained us this far and we know it will do the same going forward. Please be in prayer as we begin our home study and plan out logistics in the coming days.

<br><br>Another way you can partner with us is by making a donation to help bring our daughter home. If you would like to make a donation please do so using the option above or if you want to reach out to us in a different way you can email us: stricklandadoption@idlefusion.com

<br><br>Once again, thank you for your support in these days. We look forward to bringing our daughter home soon and cannot wait to see the story God writes.

<br><br>Love,

<br><b>Matthew, Katie, Ella, Jad and Evan Strickland</b></p>
